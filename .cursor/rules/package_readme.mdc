# 📝 Package README Format Guidelines

## Overview
This rule file provides guidelines for creating consistent, well-structured README files for packages in the project. Follow this format to maintain a professional and informative documentation style.

## 📄 Main Format

The package README should follow this general structure:

```md
# 📄 Package Name

[![style: very good analysis][very_good_analysis_badge]][very_good_analysis_link]

A concise description of what the package does and its primary value proposition.

## ✨ Features

- **Key Feature One**: Brief description of this feature
- **Key Feature Two**: Brief description of this feature
- **Key Feature Three**: Brief description of this feature
- **Key Feature Four**: Brief description of this feature

## 🔍 Overview

A more detailed explanation of the package's purpose, how it fits into the architecture, and its general approach.

## 🔥 External Services (if applicable)

If the package integrates with external services like Firebase, provide links to those resources:
[service-name/resource](mdc:https:/link-to-resource)

## 💡 Usage

```dart
// Example code showing how to initialize and use the package
final repository = Repository(
  dependencies,
);

// Example showing how to use the package
try {
  final result = await repository.performAction();
  // Use the result...
} on SpecificException catch (e) {
  // Handle exception...
}
```

## 💻 Installation

**❗ In order to start using Package Name you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  package_name:
    path: path/to/package_name
```

Or install via `flutter pub add`:

```sh
flutter pub add package_name
```

## 📦 Dependencies

- [dependency_one](mdc:https:/pub.dev/packages/dependency_one): Brief description of whr
- [dependency_two](mdc:https:/pub.dev/pack_two): Brief description of what it's used for


## 🛠️ Exception Handling

The package uses custom exception classes to provide detailed error information:

- **SpecificExceptionOne**: When a specific operation fails
- **SpecificExceptionTwo**: When another specific operation fails
- **GenericOperationException**: When a generic operation fails

## 🧪 Running Tests

For first time users, install the [very_good_cli][very_good_cli_link]:

```sh
dart pub global activate very_good_cli
```

To run all unit tests:

```sh
very_good test --coverage
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](mdc:https:/github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```

2. **Badges**: Include badges for analysis style, build tools, and license.
   
3. **Concise description**: Start with a brief, clear description of the package's purpose.
   
4. **Feature list with emojis**: Use bullet points with emojis to highlight key features.
   
5. **Usage examples**: Show practical code examples of how to use the package.
   
6. **Installation instructions**: Provide clear steps for adding the package to a project.
   
7. **Dependencies with links**: List all dependencies with links to their pub.dev pages.
      
8. **Exception handling section**: Detail the custom exceptions and their purposes.
   
9. **Testing instructions**: Include steps for running tests and generating coverage reports.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

When creating or updating a README for a package:

1. Replace "Package Name" with the actual package name.
   
2. Ensure all links are working and point to the correct resources.
   
3. Include practical code examples that demonstrate common use cases.
   
4. Choose appropriate emojis for features that represent their functionality.
   
5. Provide clear descriptions of potential errors and exceptions in the exception handling section.
   
6. If the package integrates with external services (Firebase, APIs, etc.), include relevant links.
   
7. Keep the badges section up to date with correct links.
   
8. Use appropriate emojis that match the section content.
